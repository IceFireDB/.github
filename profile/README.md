IceFireDB is a database built for web3 and web2,The core mission of the project is to help applications quickly achieve decentralization. At present, the storage layer supports various storage methods such as disk, OSS, and IPFS. The protocol layer currently supports RESP, and will support SQL and GraphQL in the future. A blockchain fusion layer based on Ethereum and EOS is under construction to integrate with higher-level decentralized computing platforms and applications as well as identity, financial assets, intellectual property and sidechain protocols. IceFireDB strives to fill the gap of the decentralized stack, making web3 application data storage more convenient and web2 application easier to achieve decentralization.
